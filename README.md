# A Quake III Algorithm 
- Whilst implementing physics, lighting or reflections in a game engine, it is helpful if the vectors that are being dealt with are normalised to length one.   

- Length of the vector _`L = {x/sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)}`_ Similarly for y and z.  

## Problem Statement üõ†

- To reduce the time taken to calculate squareroot of a number and hence make normalized vector calculations faster.  

## Background üìë

- Addition and Multiplication operations are common operations and are generally rapid. But when it comes to the [sqrt](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sqrt-sqrtl-sqrtf-cpp/) function, the operation is much slower. P.s Division is not much better either. 

- Here, we try to find the approximate value of square-root without actually using the square root function. This approximate value is within an error of 1% of the actual value. The TLDR of this operation is; as long as it's fast, we can save a lot of precious time. 

## Result ‚òëÔ∏è
-  The algorithm is approximately 3 times as fast with an 1% error margin with respect to the square root function.

### IEEE 754

A 32 bit number declared in c or cpp looks like 
`00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`

In case of floating point numbers, where we want to store in the decimal places as well, we could think of the 32 bits as of something like this:

`00000000 00000000 . 00000000 00000000`

But a more clever and efficient way to store floating point numbers with maximum range is what IEEE 754 is about.
